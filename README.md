# Scientific Visualization - Project 14
The goal for this project was to create a Jupyter widget which could interactively display the output of a  PhysiCell simulation.  This included the ability to move through the environment, color the objects in the environment, visualize the attributes of a selected cell through graphs, and create an animation of the simulation.
